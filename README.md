 - Gather up all the Marc files and send a concatenated file to the Marc4J converter, a step is added to look up authority keys, get the 92X URI and put it in the subfield 0 where the LOC BF1 converter will handle it.
 -  Look for the Marcxml file and send it to the LOC BF1 converter

All files are moved to the Archive/.. folder for future reference.
